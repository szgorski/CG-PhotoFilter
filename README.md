# Photo Filter
The repository includes a project created for Computer Graphics' classes at my university. 
The solution is written in C#/WinForms.

Implemented functionalities include:
- preset functional (e.g. brightness correction, contrast enhancement) filters,
- preset convolutional (e.g. Gaussian blur, edge detection, custom) and custom filters,
- dithering using preset error diffusion kernels,
- color quantization using the popularity algorithm,
- GUI with a preview of changes.
